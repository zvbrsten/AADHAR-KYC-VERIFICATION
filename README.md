# Aadhaar + Liveness + Face Verification System

A powerful desktop application built in **Python (Tkinter + OpenCV)** that performs:
- Aadhaar OCR  
- Age Verification  
- Liveness Check via Blink Detection  
- Spoof Detection on Selfie  
- Face Matching between Aadhaar and Selfie

Webcam-powered application that uses image processing and ML for liveness and spoof detection.

## Features

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Aadhaar Upload** | Upload an image of Aadhaar (front side). |
| **OCR + DOB Extraction** | Extracts text and detects Date of Birth from Aadhaar using OCR. |
| **Age Verification** | Checks if user is **18+** based on DOB. |
| **Liveness Check** | Detects **5 blinks live via webcam** to ensure person is real. |
| **Selfie Capture** | Automatically captures a selfie after successful blink detection. |
| **Spoof Detection** | Checks for **screen/photo attacks** using blur + color variance. |
| **Face Matching** | Compares Aadhaar photo with selfie and shows similarity score. |
